      My name is <span class="text-red-500">Tejas Magade</span> and I am
      learning in the Third Year of IT engineering. I love to code and
      especially I am very passionate about web development. I learned all the
      basics of web development and now I am learning the Django framework and
      Android development. I also know the C, Python, and Java programming
      languages. And I also love to explore new programming languages. From my
      web development knowledge, I developed my own blogging website, 2 clients
      business websites, and I am also working on some new projects.
